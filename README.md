# Topic-Modeling
Extracting the speech out of domain specific talk (Domain : Insurance in this example) videos and comparing those with some pre-determined documents, to find out the closest matches and most commonly used terms.
The video files are processed to yield the audio content, upon which the Google Speech API is implemented to extract the speech content out of them
Word tokenizations are implemented and multigrams are formed out of them
The two most commonly used techniques for Topic Modeling are used : Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorisation
Additionally the domain terms for comparison are collected and categorically stored
Finally the algorithms are implemented upon and the most common topics are retrieved
